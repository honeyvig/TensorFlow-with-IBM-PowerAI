# TensorFlow-with-IBM-PowerAI
IBM PowerAI is a suite of AI tools that run on IBM Power Systems, utilizing the performance capabilities of the hardware and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others. Although there is no specific Python API for IBM PowerAI, the tools provided by IBM PowerAI are optimized to work with popular Python machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, using the power of IBM's hardware architecture.

Below, I'll provide an example Python code for utilizing IBM PowerAI with deep learning frameworks, specifically using TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are supported on IBM Power Systems.
1. Using TensorFlow with IBM PowerAI

If you have IBM PowerAI installed on your system, you can use TensorFlow optimized for Power Architecture. This would allow TensorFlow to run efficiently on IBM Power servers.
Example: Training a simple neural network for classification using TensorFlow.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Load the MNIST dataset (for demonstration)
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
train_images = train_images.reshape((train_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1))
train_images = train_images.astype("float32") / 255

test_images = test_images.reshape((test_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1))
test_images = test_images.astype("float32") / 255

# Convert labels to categorical format
train_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels, 10)
test_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels, 10)

# Build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
    layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", 
              loss="categorical_crossentropy", 
              metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.1)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")

Explanation:

    TensorFlow on IBM PowerAI: IBM PowerAI is optimized to accelerate machine learning workloads, leveraging the computational power of IBM Power systems. When running on IBM Power servers, TensorFlow will automatically take advantage of the optimized libraries such as libomp and power9 acceleration.

2. Using PyTorch with IBM PowerAI

Similar to TensorFlow, PyTorch can be optimized on IBM Power systems. You can install PyTorch optimized for Power architecture, and it will run more efficiently on Power systems.
Example: Training a simple neural network for classification using PyTorch.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Define a simple CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)  # Flatten the output
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Load dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])
trainset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
testset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)

trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleCNN()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 5
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    running_loss = 0.0
    for images, labels in trainloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {running_loss/len(trainloader)}")

# Test the model
model.eval()
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for images, labels in testloader:
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print(f"Test Accuracy: {100 * correct / total}%")
